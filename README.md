## How is this helpful?

I taught English in Korea for four years across four grade levels (3rd-6th grade). Though the students changed over the years, the lesson contents barely did. I found myself updating presentation slides to accommodate the small vocabulary changes. I discovered my colleagues felt the same frustration as I did. Not to mention, I could have spent more time assessing student performance or evaluating possibilities in better ways to teach.

This program eliminates multiple and redundant presentations for English classes. It provides access to all vocabulary lessons at once with editing ease, creating efficiencies in the work day. This is a **_supplemental_** activity for teachers' lessons to help save on lesson planning hours.
